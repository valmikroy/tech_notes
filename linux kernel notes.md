### Process



`include/linux/sched.h`

```C
struct task_struct {

...

  // -1 unrunnable , 0 runnable , >0 stopped:
	volatile long 							state;

	// Current CPU:
	unsigned int 								cpu;
	cpumask_t 									cpus_allowed;

	const struct sched_class 		*sched_class;
	struct sched_entity 				se;
	int 												prio;

	pid_t 											pid;


	// Real parent process:
	struct task_struct __rcu 		*real_parent;
	struct list_head 						children;


	// Filesystem information:
	struct fs_struct						*fs;

	// Open file information:
	struct files_struct 				*files;


	...
}
```

- Above get manged in doublly linked `task_list`

- When a process makes a `clone()` syscall, `_do_fork()` is executed due to system call definitions of clone in `kernel/fork.c.` call reached to `copy_process()` which does most of the intersting parts like

  - error handling and the duplicate task with `dup_task_struct()`

  - scheduling specific work done by `sched_fork()`

  - based on the clone flag parent's resource get copied, this is important while forking for a thread because linux treats thread as a process with some additional resource sharing with the parent. Thread cloning flags

    ```
    clone(CLONE_VM | CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGHAND, 0);
    ```

  - `alloc_pid()` gives a pid to the process.

- `_do_fork()` wakes up newly created task with `wake_up_new_task()`

- Note about golang subroutine - they do not translate into OS threads.





#### Exercise
- look at `pidstat` cheat sheets to know more information about process
- `execsnoop` is the only efficient way to track past spawned processes.








### Scheduling

There are scheduling classes

- **SCHED NORMAL** - normal process class
- **SCHED FIFO ** - this is the class which run in the real time priority without any time slice, that means it process with this class of scheduling runs till it is finished or interrupted by other process with the higher priority.
- **SCHED RR** - this is the real time priority with the time slice. This process gets preempted.



O(1) scheduler was the old scheduler where according to nice value attached to each process there was a fixed time slice given to process. It is assumed, that the scheduler assigns timeslices of 100ms to processes with default priority (nice value 0) and timeslices of 5ms to processes with the least priority (nice value 19). Process priorities between 0 and 19 are also mapped to fixed timeslices. This had a lot of inefficencies and got replaced in `2.6` kernel with CFS.



#### CFS

This algorithm try to be fair with the scheduling prioirites of the task. Amount of time can be taken by a process depends on

- niceness
- amount of time spent by a process on the CPU

This also manages real-time priority tasks.



Configuration param `sched_latency_ns` which defines targeted preemption latency for CPU bound tasks. That means, it defines timeslice for each tasks based on number tasks in the run queue.

```
timeslice for the task = sched_latency_ns * (task's weight/total weight of tasks in the run queue)
```

There is a complimentry param `sched_min_granularity_ns` which governs minimum value of the `timeslice` of the task to reduce OS's preempting overheads.

When number of tasks becomes more than the ratio of `sched_latency_ns/sched_min_granularity_ns` then `sched_latency_ns`  value get replaced by ` sched_min_granularity_ns * total tasks`.



Once above timeslice is assigned to the process it get scheduled for a run on the CPU and accounted its CPU execution time as process's runtime. This process runtime is abstracted in the form of `vruntime` based on priority of the process. Higher priority process are recorded for lesser than their actual runtime on the CPU. This enabled them to have more CPU time.

`vruntime` is a part of the `sched_entity` struct, which itself is referenced in the `task_struct` of a process. This update is done by `update_curr` which get invovked periodically and adds value of `calc_delta_fair` to task's `curr->vruntime` in the weighted form.



sched/fair.c

```C
//Update the current task’s runtime statistics.
static void update_curr(struct cfs_rq *cfs_rq)
{
	struct sched_entity *curr = cfs_rq ->curr;
  u64 now = rq_clock_task(rq_of(cfs_rq));
  u64 delta_exec;
...
  delta_exec = now - curr->exec_start;
  curr->exec_start = now;
...
//statistics
  schedstat_set(curr->statistics.exec_max,
  max(delta_exec, curr->statistics.exec_max));

  curr->sum_exec_runtime += delta_exec;
  schedstat_add(cfs_rq->exec_clock, delta_exec);

  curr->vruntime += calc_delta_fair(delta_exec, curr);     
  update_min_vruntime(cfs_rq);
}
```



`sched_migration_cost_ns` is reference number to determine the cache hotness and to void its migration.

Now, processes are sorted based on the `vruntime` in the form of red-black balanced binary tree. Any insert, update and delete can be made in O(log(n)). This tree's leftmost node is always with the least runtime which becomes the next runnable process. This happens with the `pick_next_task`.



IO bound tasks get removed from the above RB tree with the `dequeue_entity` while getting marked as a NONRUNNABLE. Task marks itself as sleeping and puts itself on the wait queue. , calls `schedule()` to select next process to run. When such tasks wakes up and get added back into the run queue, it will have vruntime setup to 0 which makes it most runnable task.





Preemption of the task can only happen when it is not holding any locks and kernel keeps track of the count of locks by the task in the form of `preempt_count`.  Task will only get preempted if that count is zero. Sometimes higher priority task sets up `need_resched` on currently blocked task to get rescheduled immidiately once it comes out of interrupt handler.



- WatchDog and migration has real time priority.



#### Exercise

- where IO bound processes sleeps? the work queue ? How such queue is implemented. How such process get awaken.

- `vruntime` ??

- Nice time shown in the top output?









# Interrrupts

- Interrupt processing is done while normal scheduling is halted.
- Interrupt execution is divided into
  - Top Halves
  - Bottom Halves (softirqs, tasklets and work queues)
- Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) which stores ISR and an entry for each interrupt is called a gate.
- PCI-MSI - Message Signaled Interrupts are different PCI beast
- `/proc/interrupts`



#### Bottom Halves

This section of the code carried out by following

- Softirq : these are the actions setup during compile time of the kernel and get triggered by various IRQs as apart of bottom halves processing. Multiple sofirq instances can run in parallel. This get scheduled in the IRQ context.
- Tasklet: these are implemented on top of softirq and defined at the runtime. It has a serial execution.
- Workqueue:  this is a worker thread attached per processor. These usually get scheduled outside of the irq context so they can be blocked or sleep and has less memory allocation restirctions. Kworker process can be seen in `kworker/%u:%d%s (cpu, id, priority)` format.



Softirqs are used generally for urgent execution like netowrk traffic handling. Various other work actions implemented through softirq can be found `/proc/softirqs`











####Exercise

- MSI read up
- get some examples which uses tasklet and workqueue for  process
- how you monitor performance of the above?







# Kernel Synchronization Methods





##### Atomic

Atomic data types and operations will safeguard updates and reads inside the kernel.



##### Spinlock

Simple synchronization which lock the access for single process who acquires the lock and all other process keeps spinning around the lock untill it gets released.

- It can not be blocked for long time because spinning processes consumes CPU.
- this mechanism is much cheaper to implement



##### Semaphore

A semaphore is like waiting queue attached to a spin lock where processes will be waiting on the queue instead of spinning.

Semaphore also allows multiple threads to acquire a lock.



Exercise

- what is this IPCS based semaphore, I guess they are different than kernel space.



##### Mutex

Mutex is the semaphore with only one thread/process allowing to acquire lock on the resource.

- Mutex has to be released in same context
- this does not allow recursive locking, that means same thread can not lock on same mutex again.
- look the following where mutex is based on spin lock



 linux/kernel/locking/mutex.c

```C
void __sched mutex_unlock(struct mutex *lock) {
	#ifndef CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC
	if (__mutex_unlock_fast(lock)) return;
	#endif
__mutex_unlock_slowpath(lock, _RET_IP_);
}
```

```C
static noinline void __sched __mutex_unlock_slowpath( struct mutex *lock , unsigned long ip)
{
	struct task_struct *next = NULL; DEFINE_WAKE_Q(wake_q);
	unsigned long owner;
	mutex_release(&lock->dep_map, 1, ip);
/*
* Release the lock before (potentially) taking the spinlock such that * other contenders can get on with things ASAP.
*
* Except when HANDOFF, in that case we must not clear the owner field, * but instead set it to the top waiter.
*/

owner = atomic_long_read(&lock->owner);

  for (;;) {
		unsigned long old;
		#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES
    DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(__owner_task(owner) != current); 		        
    DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(owner & MUTEX_FLAG_PICKUP);
    #endif
		if (owner & MUTEX_FLAG_HANDOFF) break;
		old = atomic_long_cmpxchg_release(&lock->owner, owner, 		
                                      __owner_flags(owner));
		if (old == owner) {
			if (owner & MUTEX_FLAG_WAITERS)
				break;

      return;
		}
		owner = old;
  }

  spin_lock(&lock->wait_lock);
  debug_mutex_unlock(lock);
	if (!list_empty(&lock->wait_list)) {
		/* get the first entry from the wait-list: */
    struct mutex_waiter *waiter = list_first_entry(&lock->wait_list,
				struct mutex_waiter , list);

    next = waiter ->task;

    debug_mutex_wake_waiter(lock, waiter);
    wake_q_add(&wake_q, next);
  }

  if (owner & MUTEX_FLAG_HANDOFF)
    __mutex_handoff(lock, next);

  spin_unlock(&lock->wait_lock);

  wake_up_q(&wake_q);
}
```



##### Others

- There are other special locks like Read/Write lock where two activities are separated out for locking.

- There is something called RCU which is another synchronization mechanism in place.

- There is `sequential lock` which is like semaphore with the ordered queue.

- There usued to be `Big Kernel lock` which has been phased out.

- `Completion variable` is a simple solution to use of the semaphore where thread will wait to let complete variable value updates.

- Interrupt disabling in IRQ context and bottom haves

  ```C
  spin_lock_irqsave(&lock, flags);
  spin_unlock_irqrestore(&lock, flags);

  spin_lock_bh ();
  spin_unlock_bh ();
  ```

- Preemption disabling - this is available , how?

# Booting





#### BIOS and pre-BIOS

- Computer wakes up 

- wakes up CPU 

- default values in CPU registers 

- kicks in real mode 

- 20 bit address bus has capability to address 1MB of memory but CPU registers are 16bit then it has ability address 64KB at once. So 1MB memory divided into 64KB segments. those will be 16 segments.

- Physical address (20bit) = Segment selection * 16 + offset.  (CS:IP)

- Maximum theorotical addressable memory in this setting will be 64KB above 1MB. 

  ```assembly
  >>> hex((0xffff << 4) + 0xffff)
  '0x10ffef'  <- 1MB + 64KB - 16bytes
  ```

  

- In practise it becomes `0x00ffef` with the [A20 line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A20_line) disabled.

- With all the initial values in `CS` there is the address `0xfffffff0`, which is 16 bytes below 4GB called reset vector position.

- Reset vector where CPU finds its first instruction to execute which points to BIOS.

- BIOS selects boot device then continue booting 

- worth looking at  [coreboot](https://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Memory_map) documentation where BIOS ROM get mapped to address location.

  ```
  0xFFFE_0000 - 0xFFFF_FFFF: 128 kilobyte ROM mapped into address space
  ```

- after this BIOS selects boot device which loads boot loader

#### Boot loader

- boot loader split between MBR and first sector  of the booting device
- Boot loader fill in some headers in the linker code and loads kernel boot sector market with magic header `MZ`
  - Jump to this magic address which know as `start_of_setup`
    - Make sure that all segment register values are equal
    - Set up a correct stack, if needed
    - Set up [bss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bss)
    - Jump to the C code `main()` in [arch/x86/boot/main.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.16/arch/x86/boot/main.c)

#### Protected mode (before long mode)

- protected mode moved from 20 bit addressing (1MB) to 32 bit addressing (4GB)
- this mode also supports segmentation and paging. Previously memory segments were 64KB size but in protected mode they are different. 
- In protected mode size and location of each segment descriebd by data structure `Segment Descriptor` which is 64-bit in size. These segment descritors are stored in a data structure called the `Global Descriptor Table (GDT)`.
- GDT addressed stored in CPU 48 bit register called GDTR and can be retrived by `lgdt gdt` instruction. 
- ![img](SRE/assets/gdt_and_ldt_mapping.png)

Index can come from either GDT or LDT. GDT is to store kernel related addresses and LDT is created for each process. 

GDT or LDT plus offset will give you physical location of the memory.
**Logical Address = Segment Selector (16 bit) + Offset (13 bit)**



![img](SRE/assets/segment_selector.png)

checkout Privillage level in RPL

 The following steps are needed to get a physical address in protected mode:

- The segment selector must be loaded in one of the segment registers.
- The CPU tries to find a segment descriptor at the offset `GDT address + Index` from the selector and then loads the descriptor into the *hidden* part of the segment register.
- If paging is disabled, the linear address of the segment, or its physical address, is given by the formula: Base address (found in the descriptor obtained in the previous step) + Offset.
