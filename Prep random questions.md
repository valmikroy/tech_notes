- why `buffer_head` and `dentry` are on top of the output of slabtop? this represents highly cached memory usually due to log files.

- `sudo ss -m --info` will provide you memory consumption of the socket.
- TLB usage here the **P** is divided in x86 architecture into multiple levels of PGD (page global dir), PUD (page upper dir), PMD (page middle dir) and lowest leve in PTE. This **PTE** is mapped to **Frame number** in TLB, if it is missed then it have to crawl through entire directory structure.  TLB flushing is initiated by OS

- TLB flushing can be avoided by reducing size of the page table (especially PGD) entries by using huge pages.

- /proc/<PID>/numa_maps will provide you output like following which provides summary of which page mapped on which numa node.

  - Command to know the state of memory 

    - `sar -R`  will give you idea of rate at which cache pages and free pages are addressed
    - `sar -r ALL`   will give you all the information about regualr memory statstics like active/inactive slab/annon/stack pages. 
    - `sar -S` will give you swap related activities. one of the interesting metrics `kbswpcad` which indicates amount of pages which are both in cache and it swap.
    - `sar -B` will give you infromation on state of page daemon activity 
      - pgscank/s - Kswapd scan which only happens if free list shrinks to certain level
      - pgscand/s  - blocking application thread to allocate required memory 
      - pgsteal/s - stealing page from the page cache itself as free memory is not availble 
      - pgpgin/s and pgpgout/s - number pages bround in the memory from the disk and pushed out to the disk
    - sar -B and sar -S shows how paging is different that swapping.

  - Vmstat with `-s` option can give you quick understand of the state of system.

  - ```
    pgscan_kswapd_*, pgsteal_kswapd_*
    
    These report respectively the number of pages scanned and reclaimed by kswapd since the system started. The ratio between these values can be interpreted as the reclaim efficiency with a low efficiency implying that the system is struggling to reclaim memory and may be thrashing. Light activity here is generally not something to be concerned with.
    
    pgscan_direct_*, pgsteal_direct_* (proactive reclaimation)
    These report respectively the number of pages scanned and reclaimed by an application directly. This is correlated with increases in the allocstall counter. This is more serious than kswapd activity as these events indicate that processes are stalling. Heavy activity here combined with kswapd and high rates of pgpgin, pgpout and/or high rates of pswapin or pswpout are signs that a system is thrashing heavily.
    
    More detailed information can be obtained using tracepoints.

  - VM's commited memory is something which process thinks it has for its disposal though it is not physically getting used.
